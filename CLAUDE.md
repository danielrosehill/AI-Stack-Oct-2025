Every now and again I like to jot down some notes about my AI "stack".

The space is moving at a rapid pace and I like to record what I'm using for what and why.

Sometimes friends and clients ask me for recs ... it's also useful to just track the evolution of tooling and make some notes about why I've dropped or picked up specific components.

You can help me in two ways:

1) Convert my messy notes in the scratchpad into something other humans can understand 
2) Interview me! Ask me questions about what I use for X: why, why not. I may have a few strong opinions that we can weave in.

A secondary objective of this iteration of my stack notes is to put together a ballpark budget as it's something everyone (including me) thinks about a lot: there's an abundance of tools but businesses, and humans, have finite budgets. How much does a "luxury" stack cost, how much does a basic one cost.

I'd like to map out a few budgets based on different sets of assumptions but I'd like to keep these separate from the main readme and link off to them. 

I want to also make clear: this is not prescriptive. By which I mean: it's just a point in time capture of what I, as one person, see value in and my thoughts. Everybody is different.
